🚀 AI WEBSITE BUILDER – FULL FEATURE SPECIFICATION DOCUMENT

Platform: Replit
Project Owner: [Your Name]
Objective: Build a fully AI-assisted website creation platform that gathers all necessary information from the client, analyzes competitors, designs the layout, generates SEO content, and produces stunning, high-performance websites—either automatically or under user guidance.
