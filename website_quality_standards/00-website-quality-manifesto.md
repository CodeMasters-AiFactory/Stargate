## Critical Rules for Rating

1. **Never call a site "excellent" if ANY category is below 7.5/10**
2. **Compare against real, top-tier websites in that industry** (not just "it works" or "it doesn't crash")
3. **Be specific in feedback** - "add location keywords to H1" not "improve SEO"
4. **Consider the target audience** - a law firm needs different standards than a portfolio site
5. **Evaluate actual content quality** - not just "content exists"
   - Generic filler like "We deliver exceptional quality" = poor content
   - Specific details like "Corporate law for SMEs in Pretoria" = good content
6. **Check for generic elements** - stock photos, template layouts, placeholder text, confetti backgrounds
7. **Test user journeys** - can users actually accomplish their goals?
8. **Verify technical quality** - SEO, accessibility, performance matter
9. **Be honest and critical** - if it looks like a generic template, rate it as such (2-3/10), not "excellent"
10. **Require brand identity** - colors, typography, spacing must feel like a unique brand, not arbitrary choices

## Examples of What "Excellent" Means

### Law Firm Website (Excellent = 7.5-8.5)

- **Conversion:** "Book Consultation" CTAs, phone number prominent, contact form, trust badges
