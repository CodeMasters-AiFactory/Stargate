# Automation Status - Coca-Cola Website Build

## Current Status: Phase 2 - Filling Form Fields

**Progress**: Filling 21 required fields systematically

### Completed:
- ✅ Phase 1: Ultra package selected
- ✅ Domain dropdown: Clicked, selecting "Have domain" option

### In Progress:
- 🔄 Filling remaining dropdowns (industry, website type, call-to-action, tone, mobile, design, font, country, color)
- 🔄 Filling remaining text fields (address, domain name, target audience, brand style, service details)
- 🔄 Clicking page buttons (Home, About, Service/Product, Contact)
- 🔄 Clicking feature buttons (Contact Form, Social Media Link)
- 🔄 Setting colors (primary: #F40009, accent: #FFFFFF)

### Strategy:
Using browser automation to fill fields one by one. This is slower than JavaScript injection but more reliable. Will continue systematically until all 21 errors are resolved, then click "Continue to Investigation".
