# How to Navigate to Your Website Page

## Current Status
Your website page exists at view name: `'website-page'`
Component: `WebsitePage.tsx`

## Ways to Navigate:

1. **From IDE Page**: Click "View Website Page" button (if it works)
2. **From Services Page**: Click "Back to Website" button (should work after fixes)
3. **Manual Navigation**: The view needs to be set to `'website-page'`

## What the Website Page Shows:
- Similar to IDE page but without sidebar
- Project creation interface
- Template selection
- Recent projects list

## Current Issue:
The "View Website Page" button click is failing with a JavaScript error. The routing logic is correct, but the button click handler may have an issue.
