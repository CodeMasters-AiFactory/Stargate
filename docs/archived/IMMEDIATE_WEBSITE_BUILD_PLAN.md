# 🚀 IMMEDIATE WEBSITE BUILD PLAN

**User Request:** Build website NOW, skip investigation phases, show the website

## Current Issue
Browser automation is having trouble clicking buttons. The user wants to see the website immediately.

## Solution Strategy

1. **Navigate to wizard** - Use direct URL or find working button reference
2. **Select package** - Ultra package
3. **Fill minimal required fields:**
   - Business name: Coca-Cola
   - Industry: Food & Beverage
   - (Skip other fields for speed)
4. **Jump to Phase 16 (build)** - Use phase dropdown to navigate directly to 'build' stage
5. **Generate website** - Click generate button

## Phase 16 Stage Name
From code: `'build'` is the stage name for Phase 16: Website Builder

## Alternative Approach
If browser automation continues to fail, I may need to:
- Use keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter)
- Or modify the code to add a "Quick Build" button that skips investigation
- Or provide instructions for manual navigation

**Status:** Attempting direct URL navigation...
